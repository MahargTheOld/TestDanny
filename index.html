<p>No, let's change that to Jonathan, resolving the John-vs-Jon debate once and for all.</p>

<h1>iPad and GitHub</h1>

<p>By the way, Jonathan, for this, I'm using a cool iOS app called &quot;Working Copy.&quot; It seems to make working with git and GitHub much easier. So far, at least.</p>

<p>Combining <em>Working Copy</em> with a markdown app that uses GFM, <em>IA Writer</em>, and you get a great workflow. </p>
